This Java program is a console-based task management application that allows users to manage a list of tasks through a menu-driven interface. The program provides the following functionalities:

0. "Exit" – Users can exit the application by selecting the exit option.

1. "Add a new task" – Users can input a new task. A confirmation message is displayed after the task is added.

2. "Remove a task" – The program displays all existing tasks, allowing users to remove a task by entering its name. If the task list is empty, an appropriate message is shown. If a task is successfully removed, a confirmation message is displayed.

3. "Show all tasks" – The program lists all tasks in the current task list. If the list is empty, it notifies the user accordingly.

4. "Remove all tasks" – Users can remove all tasks at once, and the program will confirm the deletion. If the task list is already empty, it notifies the user.
